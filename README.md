###### **Problem Statement**

Generate a random dataset with 1000 data points and 10 classes (classification
problem). Perform sampling (with and without repetitions) on the dataset and find
the proper number of samples required such that there should be at least one
representative point (k) from each class.
Plot a probability v/s sample size graph. The probability represents the chances of
getting at least one representative point from each class.
Perform the above experiment with k = 1,2,3,4.
Plot a graph representing the frequency of each proper sample size obtained.
Submit a report along with your code and inferences, comparisons, and graphs.
Your analysis and the detailed process followed should be reported neatly.
